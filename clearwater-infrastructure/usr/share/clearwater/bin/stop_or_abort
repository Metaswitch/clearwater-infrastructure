# This utility script does an abort of a service, if it hasn't aborted for
# at least a day.  If the script has been used to abort the process more
# recently than 24 hours ago, the script just stops the service instead.

# The script is intended to be used in those cases where a service is
# misbehaving and a core file needs to be generated, but where we don't want
# all existing diagnostic sets to be flushed out if the condition keeps
# happening
